    "This notebook displays data from two sets of tests. The first is is with ten alphas ranging from 0 to 90 in steps of 10 (alpha_coef = 10), and the second is with ten alphas ranging from 0 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1. The first set of tests with larger alphas shows cases where BSG performs slightly better than MSG. In both tests, tau is fixed at 10."
